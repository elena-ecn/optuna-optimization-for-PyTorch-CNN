# Hyperparameter optimization study for a PyTorch CNN with Optuna.

This project includes a hyperparameter optimization example of a PyTorch 
Convolutional Neural Network for the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits using 
the hyperparameter optimization framework Optuna.

It shows how to use Optuna with a PyTorch CNN that uses classes (OOP) in order 
to maximize test accuracy.

#### About the dataset
The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images,
where each sample is a small, square, 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale image of 
handwritten single digits between 0 and 9.
